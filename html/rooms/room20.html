      <h1>The Revelation</h1>
      <p>
        As you step into the final chamber of the Orokin Derelict, the air hums
        with a palpable energy. Before you lies the source of all the mysteries
        and challenges you've faced - a relic of immense power, glowing with an
        inner light that seems to pulse in time with your own heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is no ordinary artifact; it's a piece of lost Orokin technology,
        its purpose as enigmatic as the civilization that created it. You
        realize that this relic holds the key to untold power, capable of
        shifting the balance in the system. Its discovery could ignite a war
        among the factions, or it could bring a new era of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Tenno, the weight of this decision rests on your shoulders. Do you
        take the relic and use its power to shape the future? Do you destroy it,
        fearing its potential for destruction? Or do you leave it hidden,
        guarding its secret, as you continue your eternal vigil?
      </p>
      <p>
        The chamber around you seems to hold its breath, waiting for your
        decision. In this moment, you're not just a warrior of the Void; you're
        a guardian of fate, a decider of destinies. Your choice will echo
        through the corridors of time, shaping the future of the Warframe
        universe.

        Whatever your choice, your journey through the Echoes of the Void has
        forever changed you. You emerge from the Orokin Derelict, not just as a
        survivor, but as a legend, a Tenno who faced the unknown and made a
